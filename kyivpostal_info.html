       <h2><u> About The Postal Square </u></h2>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> The Postal Square in Kyiv is one of the oldest historic squares of the city. It is a great place to sit and relax. In the last years young skaters use the square for performing their tricks. The square is usually filled with young people who hang out and eat McDonalds which is located right on the square. The square has 2 staircases going down to a quay where small cafes are located. The quay offers a great view at the bridges connecting Kyiv and you can observe tourist boats roaming in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper"> Dnieper</a> river. 
      
<h2><u> Near The Postal Square </u></h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> The Postal Square is located next to the Independence Square so there are lots of tourist attractions to give a try. Right next to the Postal Square there is a funicular railway which was built back in 1905 leading to the top of a hill where there is a national park to explore. Also from the square you can notice Arch of Freedom of the Ukrainian People which was built amidst to the celebration of the 1,500th Anniversary of Kyiv, to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the USSR and the "reunification of Ukraine with Russia in 1654". However in 2022 the statue next to the Arch of Freedom that showed a Ukranian and a Russian worker standing together was removed due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"> 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine</a>. </p>
