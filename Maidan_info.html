      <h2><u> About Maidan </u></h2>
       <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Maidan Nezalezhnosti is the center of Kyiv where you can meet many tourists, visit boutique stores, and an underground mall called "Globus". You can also look at the old architecture that surrounds the square. Sometimes people come there to hang out with friends and watch people perform in the middle of the street. Maidan Nezalezhnosti is surrounded by entertainment so you won't get bored.</p>
    <h2><u> Maidan's History </u></h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Maidan Nezalezhnosti went through a lot of events. This is the place where Ukraine has celebrated its independence from Soviet Union in 1991 and anually celebrates of Independece of Ukraine on 24th of August. For the last 2 years however, Kyiv wasn't able to hold this event due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine"> Russian Invasion of Ukraine</a>. Instead these 2 years we exhibited Russian tanks that Ukraine has defeated for people to see. Also this year, the government tried to control how many people gather at the Independence Square for their own safety.

<h2><u> The Revolution of Dignity </u></h2>
 <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> In 2013 because the 4th president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych decided not to sign a political association and free trade agreement with European Uninion, protests occured on the Independence Square. The protests have lasted for about 100 days and lots of Ukranians and foreigners have participated in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan"> Euromaidan</a> protests. As a result, 108 people have died. This event was a national tragedy for Ukraine. The aftermath was also devastating. Even though Ukranians managed to remove President Yanukovych from his post and elect a new president, Yanukovych left to Russia which sparked the collapse of relations with Russia and caused the Russo-Ukranian War. </p>
