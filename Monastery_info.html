    <h2><u> About The Monastery </u></h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> The St. Michael's Golden Domed Monastery is truly a captivating and historical place. The St. Michael's Monastery was established in 1108-1113. Much of the monastery, including the cathedral church, was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s. The complex was rebuilt following Ukrainian independence in 1991; the cathedral reopened in 1999. The interior is filled with different artworks and Eucharist mosaics. Behind the sepulcher was a five-tiered gold and silver-gilt iconostasis, donated by the Cossack nobleman Ivan Skoropadsky in 1718. replacing the one installed in the cathedral in 1631. The iconostasis, which was made by the Chernihiv (a city north of Kyiv) craftsman Hryhoriy Petrov, had icons were painted by the Kyiv priest Stefan Lubenskyi. The top four tiers were removed in 1888, when ancient mosaics and frescoes were discovered. The iconostasis remained as a single tier until 1935. </p>
    
    <h2><u> Events Held At The Square In Front of The Monastery </u></h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> In the last 20 years many events were held at the square in front of the St. Michael's Monastery. Almost every year the square held New Year's Eve trade fairs and in the center of the square stood a tall pine tree decorated with beautiful ornaments. I myself visited the trade fair in December of 2021, and it was truly an amazing experience. Also, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_of_Dignity">Maidan Revolution</a> in 2014 people hosted health aid and feeding centers where they helped the protesters survive the cold days and nights at Maidan Square. </p>
