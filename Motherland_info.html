<h2><u> About The Monument </u></h2>
      <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> Mother Ukraine (previously named Mother Motherland) is a monument built in 1981 to symbolise the Soviet victory in World War II. The Mother Ukraine monument is 102 meters which is taller than the Statue of Liberty in New York City (93 meters). Its a wonderful tourist attraction which has a World War 2 Museum under the monument and an observation tower on top of the monument shield. </p>

<h2><u> History and The Recent Changes </u></h2>
<p style="text-indent: 25px;"> The Mother Ukraine monument had a Soviet symbol on the shield to signify unity of Soviet Union. The Soviet symbol stayed the same even after Ukraine has gained its independence in 1991. However just recently in August 2023 the symbol on the shield was changed to Ukrainain coat of arms emblem due to war with Russia and the long gone Soviet Union era. The reconstruction took only one month with severe weather conditions and constant air raid sirens. Also, the name of the monument was changed from "Mother Motherland" to "Mother Ukraine" at the same time as the shield symbol was reconstructed. Now Ukranians can confidently claim that the Mother Ukraine monument is the pride of Ukraine and symbolizes Ukraine's independence! </p>
